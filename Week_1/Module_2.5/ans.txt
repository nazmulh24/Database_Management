1. What is the difference between Data and Information?
    - Data: Raw, unprocessed facts and figures without context (e.g., "123", "John").
    - Information: Processed, organized, and meaningful data (e.g., "John has a salary of $123").

2. Describe Primary Key, Composite Primary Key, Foreign Key with example:
    - Primary Key: A unique identifier for a record in a table (e.g., EmployeeId in an Employee table).
    - Composite Primary Key: A primary key made up of two or more columns (e.g., OrderId and ProductId in an OrderDetails table).
    - Foreign Key: A column in one table that references the primary key of another table (e.g., CustomerId in an Orders table referencing CustomerId in a Customers table).

3. Five numeric type Data Types of MySQL:
    - INT
    - BIGINT
    - FLOAT
    - DOUBLE
    - DECIMAL

4. Create a table named Employee with EmployeeId, EmployeeName, EmployeeSalary, and JoiningDate:
    a. Create table:
    ```
    sql
    CREATE TABLE Employee (
         EmployeeId INT PRIMARY KEY,
         EmployeeName VARCHAR(100),
         EmployeeSalary DECIMAL(10, 2),
         JoiningDate DATE
    );

    ```

    b. Insert 2 employee data:
    ```
    sql
    INSERT INTO Employee (EmployeeId, EmployeeName, EmployeeSalary, JoiningDate)
    VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000.00, '2023-01-01'),
             (2, 'Jane Smith', 60000.00, '2023-02-01');
    
    ```

    c. Delete 1 employee data:
    ```
    sql
    DELETE FROM Employee WHERE EmployeeId = 1;
    
    ```
