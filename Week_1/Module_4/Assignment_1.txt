    Difference Between Data and Information:
        •	Data is a collection of raw facts, figures, or symbols without any context. It alone has no meaning.
        Example: Numbers like 85, names like Nazmul, or colors like Red are just data.

        •	Information is processed, organized, or structured data that is meaningful and useful for making decisions.
        Example: “Nazmul scored 85 in the test and prefers the color red” is information because it gives context and meaning to the data.

    In short:
        •	Data -> Raw and meaningless on its own.
        •	Information -> Organized and meaningful data.

    -- To perform an update, safe mode must be turned off...
        set sql_safe_updates = 0; -- Safe mode off
        set sql_safe_updates = 1; -- Safe mode on
    -- After updating, safe mode must be turned on...

    Example :
        set sql_safe_updates = 0;
        update student
        SET Name = "Shahriar"
        where roll = 4;
        set sql_safe_updates = 1;
